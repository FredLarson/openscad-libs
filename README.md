# openscad-libs
A collection of my libraries for OpenSCAD.  They are intended to be installed and used with [scad_bundler](https://github.com/lostapathy/scad_bundler).

## [openscad_incubator](openscad_incubator)

This is an experimental library for code that hasn't solidified enough to to warrant a home anywhere.  Expect breaking changes, especially on code that has not not shipped with a public version.

## [openscad_soften](openscad_soften)

This library is a collection of shapes and solids that have been softened with rounded edges, chamfers, round overs, or fillets.  The API should be fairly stable, and published versions will attempt to follow semver.

## [openscad_util](openscad_util)

This library collects odds and ends that don't (yet) justify their own library, or don't fit well with other libraries.  Expect functionality to occasionally leave this library and find a new home, but those moves should be documented in the changelog.
